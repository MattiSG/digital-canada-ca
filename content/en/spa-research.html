            <h2 class="section--title">Help us make it easier to find opportunities to sell your goods or services to governments</h2>

            <p>We&rsquo;re conducting research to try to improve how businesses find opportunities to work with the public sector in Canada.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Canadian Digital Service and Public Services and Procurement Canada are trying to learn more about the experiences of businesses looking for government opportunities. We&rsquo;d like to understand what makes a good procurement opportunity for you, and what information you need to decide to respond.</p>

            <p>If you participate, for a period of one week, you&rsquo;ll be asked to:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
                <li>reflect on your daily activities related to public sector procurement&nbsp;</li>
                <li>report your experiences by email.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Right now, we&rsquo;re just asking for some basic information about your business to help us identify a diverse group of participants.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>By participating, you will help make it easier for businesses like yours to find relevant opportunities to respond to.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re interested in participating, please send an email using the button below for more information on how to be involved:</p>
